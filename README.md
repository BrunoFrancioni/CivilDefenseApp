## Section 1 - What is this?<a name="section1"></a>

### Introduction.<a name="introduction"></a>

This is a software developed in the environment of the University. The objetive is to give Civil Defense a software to manage all the events of the city, as well as see the diferents entities that exists. All the info is going to be centralized in a map, that is going to be the main object in the system.

### General idea of the solution.<a name="solution"></a>

To solve this we thought about split the system in two differents Front End.

The first one, is going to work as an administrative system. Is going to handle the Credentials of the users, the Entities and the Events, and also is going to show stats of the three main parts recently named.

The second one, is going to be the real app. It will show the map where we are going to centralize all the Entities an the Events. And, here we have the main function, that is to create a new Event but, to can create one, the user must be logged with an account created by the Adminstrator in the other system.
